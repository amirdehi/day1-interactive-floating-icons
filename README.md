# **Day 1 Challenge: Interactive Floating Icons UI**

## Task:

### Create a responsive web page with the following features:

    A collection of floating icons (at least 5 different icons) moving randomly across the screen in an animated manner.
    When the user hovers their mouse near an icon, the icons "run away" from the cursor dynamically.
    Add a reset button that stops the animations and repositions the icons to their starting points.

### Requirements:

    Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or optionally React if you want to practice with it).
    Ensure the page is responsive across different screen sizes.
    Write clean and well-documented code to explain how you achieved each feature.

### Hints:

    Use CSS animations or JavaScript requestAnimationFrame for smooth movement.
    Calculate the distance between the cursor and icons using JavaScript to create the "run away" effect.
    Use a reset function to reposition icons programmatically.

This challenge combines animation, interactivity, and basic UI principles.

All of which are useful for creating dynamic and engaging web interfaces.
